```

## My analysis that will be automated

# Data analysis
We provide here some basic elements about the data set and descriptive statistics on some variables of interest.  

* First we load the data
* second we print a summary

```{r}
TradeData <- read.csv("https://www.unsiap.or.jp/on_line/2024/RAP/Data/TradeData.csv")
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
